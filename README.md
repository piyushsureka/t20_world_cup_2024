# ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 üèèüèÜ
The analysis involves a series of exploratory visualizations and calculations that provide insights into various aspects of the tournament, including team performance, individual player statistics, toss outcomes, batting partnerships, and more. 

# Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the ICC Men‚Äôs T20 World Cup 2024 dataset to uncover insights about the matches and individual performances. By leveraging data cleaning, preliminary findings, detailed analysis, and visual representation, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the tournament.

# Datasets
We utilize two key datasets for this analysis:
### 1. Matches Dataset:
  * matches.csv
  * Description: This dataset contains information about each match, including match details, venue, teams, outcome, and more.
### 2. Deliveries Dataset:
  * deliveries.csv
  * Description: This dataset provides ball-by-ball details of the matches, offering granular insights into player performances and match dynamics.

# Hypotheses to Test
  * Effect of Toss on Match Outcome: Winning the toss increases the likelihood of winning the match.
  * Impact of Venue on Performance: Certain venues favor batting or bowling, influencing match outcomes.
  * Player Performance Analysis: Top players perform consistently across different matches and conditions.
  * Impact of Inning on Match Outcome: Batting first vs. chasing impacts the likelihood of winning.
  * Run Patterns and Winning: Higher scoring rates in the initial overs correlate with higher chances of winning.

# Methodology
The project follows these steps:
  * Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, converting data types, and transforming data for analysis.
  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigating datasets to summarize main characteristics and find patterns.
  * Advanced Analysis: Performing deeper analysis on specific topics such as top batsmen, bowlers, and team performances.
  * Visualization: Creating plots and charts to visualize findings from the data.

# Tools and Technologies
  * Python 3.7 or later
  * Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE
  * The following Python libraries:
      * Pandas
      * NumPy
      * Matplotlib
      * Seaborn
   
# üìà Results
  * Toss and Venue Analysis: The impact of winning the toss and its correlation with match outcomes is explored, along with identifying the venues with the most wins.
  * Player Performance: Top batsmen are analyzed for total runs, strike rates, and consistency. Bowlers are evaluated based on economy rates, and the best performers are highlighted.
  * Phase-wise Batting Performance: Runs scored in different game phases (Powerplay, Middle Overs, Death Overs) are analyzed to highlight key players in each phase.
  * Team and Partnership Performance: Team-wise performance is examined by calculating runs per over and boundary percentages. Successful batting partnerships are identified.
  * Batting Position Impact: The effect of batting order on run scoring is studied, comparing the contributions of opening and middle-order batsmen.
  * Dot Ball and Strike Rate Analysis: The impact of dot balls on the scoring rate is visualized, along with a study on the relationship between strike rates and runs per over.

# Conclusion
  By analyzing the ICC Men‚Äôs T20 World Cup 2024 dataset, we uncover valuable insights into match outcomes, player performances, and broader tournament trends. This data-driven approach 
  not only enhances our understanding of the game but also provides fans, analysts, and stakeholders with a deeper appreciation of the intricate dynamics that define the sport.
